# Stock Analysis and Price Prediction for Indian Equities

## Introduction
In this notebook, we explored the data of 4 major stocks in the Indian stock market viz Reliance, TCS, HDFC Bank, and Infosys.

We have also looked at a few ways of analyzing the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history and tried to predict future stock prices through a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model.

Further, we also tried to answer the following questions along the way:

1.) What was the change in price of the stock over time?

2.) What was the daily return of the stock on average?

3.) What was the moving average of the various stocks?

4.) What was the correlation between different stocks'?

5.) How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?

6.) How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior? (Predicting the closing stock price of Reliance Industries Limited using LSTM)

## Data
We have used yfinance to get the stock information, and visualized different aspects of it using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

## Tech Stack/Frameworks

Data Cleaning: NumPy, Pandas
